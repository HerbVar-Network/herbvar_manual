# Preparing Manuscripts & Presentations {#sec-publications}

Write manuscripts following the HerbVar guidelines for authorship (@sec-authorship_process) and use the checklist below to ensure all required information is included. Note that the [_HerbVar Data Analysis Template_](https://github.com/HerbVar-Network/analysis_and_paper_template) includes the files and code needed to write the manuscript in using Rmarkdown templates for scientific papers (e.g., [`papaja`](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) or one of the [`rticles`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) templates). 


## Checklist: Prior to Submission (Manuscripts &  Presentations)

- [ ] Author Lists: Verify the Name, Institution, and OrcidID of all authors. If full lists of authors are not feasible (e.g., on oral presentation abstracts) or allowed by the journal, a short authorship list can be published with “The Members of the Herbivory Variability Network” as a coauthor, and a link to the full HerbVar author list. If possible, include the full author list in the supplement.

- [ ] All HerbVar publications must include the following text in the Acknowledgements:

> "This work was generated using data from the HerbVar Network (https://herbvar.org/), which was supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. DEB-2203582). 

- [ ] If the data set used in the manuscript has been archived in a repository, please cite both the data set archive and the original article in your paper section. For example, if using the Core Dataset archived at Dryad, your manuscript or presentation should include citations to both of the following: 

> Wetzel, William; Hahn, Philip; Inouye, Brian et al. (2023). Plant size, latitude, and phylogeny explain within-population variability in herbivory [Dataset]. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.44j0zpckm

> The Herbivory Variability Network (2023). Plant size, latitude, and phylogeny explain within-population variability in herbivory. _Science_ 382,679-683. DOI:10.1126/science.adh8830

- [ ] Please cite the HerbVar Manual in the Methods section when describing how data were collected in the field.

> HerbVar Steering Committee (2024). "HerbVar: Project Manual and Field protocols (v0.9.0)". Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14232308

- [ ] Keywords: **Please use "HerbVar" as one of the keywords when submitting manuscripts.** This allows products using HerbVar to be more easily found when the articles are indexed in databases such as SCOPUS.

- [ ] Add the MS or Presentation to the Herbvar Zotero Library (Important for NSF reporting to know how many manuscripts are in review and presentations have been given.)

- [ ] Post a Preprint or the Slides (optional but encouraged)

## Checklist: Upon Acceptance (Manuscripts)

- [ ] Update the record in the Zotero library

- [ ] Archive any 'new' Data with Dryad
  
- [ ] Include a citation of the 'new' data's Dryad archive in the accepted version of the manuscript in accordance with the journal's guidelines (e.g., in the _References_, _Data Availability Statement_, etc.).  

- [ ] Archive the Analysis Repo on Zenodo. instructions on freezing the data analysis code repo on Zenodo can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) 

- [ ] Include a citation of the Analysis Repo in the accepted version of the manuscript in accordance with the journal's guidelines (e.g., in References, Data Availability Statement, etc.).  

- [ ] Archive the Manuscript Repo on Zenodo (optional). instructions on freezing the MS repo on Zenodo can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)
