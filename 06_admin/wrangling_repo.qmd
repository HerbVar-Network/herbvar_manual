# Wrangling Repository

The [Wrangling Repository](https://github.com/HerbVar-Network/Wrangling) contains scripts for data wrangling for all phases of the project. It takes in raw data and outputs analysis/visualization-ready .csv files.

It will be the primary home for this Research/Admin Position (or at least it was for me) so it may help to give you a brief explanation of each of the main scripts. Here’s the link.

## Misc. Non-Manuscript Subset Scripts

So far, this only includes the script to separate out PlantPopNet members’ data to make sharing that with PPN leadership (upon request) simpler

## Phase 1 Scripts

- `phase 1 abiotic wrangling.R`: Wrangles WORLDCLIM climatic data for phase 1 surveys. 

- `phase 1 herbivoreData wrangling.R`: Wrangles any information to do with herbivores from phase 1. 

- `phase 1 plant richness wrangling.R`: Extracts interpolated native/invasive species richness information from Ellis et al. 2012 shapefiles. 

- `phase 1 primary productivity.R`: Extracts primary productivity data from satellite data for phase 1 surveys. 

- `phase 1 shareable index.R`: Creates files of only location information for phase 1 sites to enable other HerbVar collaborators to harvest metadata without sharing “actual” data. 

- `phase 1 siteData wrangling.R`: Wrangles information from siteData sheet of template Excel file. 

- `phase 1 soil data wrangling.R`: Placeholder describing where soil data may someday be acquired. For now, the relevant R package does not work (though their team is aware of and working on this issue). 

- `phase 1 survey-lvl summarizing.R`: Summarizes the tidy plant-level (one row per plant) phase 1 data to survey-level (one row per survey). 

- `phase 1 wrangling.R`: Takes all the separate phase 1 raw data files combines and wrangles them to plant-level (one row per plant). 


## Phase 2 Scripts

- `phase 2 densityData wrangling.R`:  Wrangles eponymous sheet from template Excel file. 

- `phase 2 herbivoreData wrangling.R`: Wrangles eponymous sheet from template Excel file (at both plant-level and survey-level). 

- `phase 2 metadata `abiotic.R`:  Extracts WORLDCLIM climatic data from phase 2 site locations (requires tidy file from siteData wrangling script). 

- `phase 2 newColumns wrangling.R`:  Wrangles eponymous sheet from template Excel file. 

- `phase 2 notes wrangling.R`: Wrangles eponymous sheet from template Excel file. 

- `phase 2 plantData survey-lvl summarizing.R`:  Summarizes tidy plantData to survey-level (i.e., one row per survey). 

- `phase 2 plantData wrangling.R`:  Wrangles eponymous sheet from template Excel file (at ONLY plant-level). 

- `phase 2 reproData wrangling.R`: Wrangles eponymous sheet from template Excel file at plant-level only (survey level absent because insufficient raw data at this point). 

- `phase 2 siteData wrangling.R`:  Wrangles eponymous sheet from template Excel file.  


## Script Archive

All “actual” scripts (i.e., those used in day-to-day wrangling) should have a consistent aesthetic and comment structure (as well as being primarily tidyverse-based). When others contribute code, duplicate the file and edit one version to match internal standards. The second version goes here to be preserved in its original form as a back-up

## Singleton Tasks

Any scripts written to accomplish a ‘one-off’ task I thought unlikely to be repeated regularly are placed here. Some of them may include operations that could be useful in other contexts tough!

## Manuscript Subsetting Scripts

Each script is dedicated for a single HerbVar manuscript and does the subsetting and/or column selection necessary to create a tidy data file of only what authors request to test their hypotheses
