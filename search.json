    "section": "1.2 Motivation",
    "text": "1.2 Motivation\nPublished studies and personal observations suggest the distribution of herbivore feeding damage among individual plants within a population is often highly skewed such that most plants and plant parts (leaves, reproductive structures, etc.) experience relatively low levels of damage, and a small fraction of plants experience disproportionately high levels of damage. Theory suggests that such variability can have dramatic ecological and evolutionary consequences. For example, variability among plants can lead overall herbivore population size to be greater or less than expected based on average plant quality and asymmetric fitness surfaces can lead to over-investment in defensive traits. Surprisingly, despite the established theoretical importance and potential generality of variability in herbivory, it has received little empirical attention, limiting our fundamental understanding of how plants and herbivores interact.",

Members can get involved in the network in four main ways:\n\nBecome a Site PI by collecting data using one of the HerbVar Protocols described in this manual. Submit data towards a sampling objective and become a co-author on a publication resulting from that sampling objective (see Chapter 5 and Chapter 7).\nPropose a new Working Group. Working Groups analyze and publish existing data, design and coordinate new add-on data collection efforts, and develop educational resources with HerbVar data (see Section 6.1). You can also join an existing Working Group open to new members. \nPropose a new add-on data collection effort to have HerbVar members and Site PIs collect data you would like to analyze and publish (see Chapter 8).\n\nThis manual explains the process for each of these ways of getting involved.",

The proposed publication is then listed on the HerbVar site for other network members to see. Authors are encouraged, but not required, to invite additional network members to work with them as appropriate. See Authorship Guidelines (Chapter 7) for discussion of how and when to invite others. This process provides benefits such as access to unpublished data, information on potential overlap of the paper with other completed or ongoing analyses, advice about how to interpret the data, GitHub tools customized for analysis and publication of HerbVar data, and publicity for the publication through HerbVar channels.\nWorking Groups typically have six months to initiate work and two years from proposal to manuscript submission (or equivalent for non-manuscript projects).

Secondarily, authoring a paper within the HerbVar process benefits authors by reducing overlap among papers, fostering collaboration, streamlining use of HerbVar data to produce papers through GitHut tools, and helping to publicize HerbVar products. While prospective authors can use published HerbVar data to create products on their own, we encourage all authors working with HerbVar data to work with the network.\nThe HerbVar authorship process has been heavily influenced by the authorship process imnplemented by the Nutrient Network. This process provides ground rules for a fair and inclusive process for establishing authorship while not diluting the value of authorship on a manuscript. HerbVar is grateful to be able to build on the foundation of NutNet’s model for collaborative international ecology. The text below is edited to reflect HerbVar-specific policies, but some is drawn directly from the NutNet authorship document. Differences reflect the fact that HerbVar is a much larger network (with hundreds of contributors) and a more fluid network (contributors might only contribute data once, rather than activity maintaining an experimental site).",

    "section": "7.3 Article Categories",
    "text": "7.3 Article Categories\nIn general, HerbVar aims to be as inclusive as possible. At the same time, we acknowledge that massively multi-authored papers (e.g. with all HerbVar members) present substantial challenges for lead authors and might discourage initiation of new projects. To balance these factors, there are two types of published products in the HerbVar process: “All PI Papers” and “Working Group Papers”.\n\n7.3.1 “All-PI” Papers\nAll-PI Papers invite all site PIs meeting authorship requirements to be co-authors, acknowledging the fundamental importance of contributing data to HerbVar.\nThe HerbVar Network launched with a Steering Committee commitment to produce two papers using the core HerbVar data collected during the first phase of sampling. Site PIs earn co-authorship on these papers by providing at least 3 surveys (though more are always welcome) to the core dataset. The Steering Committee has so far launched three add-on projects (Focal Species, Focal Families, Reproductive Damage). Additional add-on projects may be created - see Datasets and Proposals for New Data Collection. Site PIs earn co-authorship on one paper from each add-on project by contributing at least three surveys that advance that project, in addition to the minimum three surveys required for Site PI status and authorship on the core HerbVar papers. See the HerbVar website and our Species selection document (in the HerbVar Protocols folder) for information on our current sampling objectives and planned manuscripts. We will be flexible on the minimum number of surveys, particularly if substantial additional intellectual contributions are made to project development (e.g., creation of documents and protocols, recruitment of collaborators able to work in under-sampled regions or with under-sampled taxa, or other network coordination work). The Steering Committee will review instances that do not meet the minimum criteria on a case-by-case basis. Please reach out if you have questions or concerns. Collaborators who set out to complete 3+ surveys but are only able to contribute 1-2 surveys will be given the opportunity to maintain authorship by contributing in other ways. Potential contributions that could make up for missing surveys include but are not limited to working on our primary database, developing our traits and/or environmental databases, and/or collecting other metadata. In addition to contributing data, Site PIs who want to be co-authors must also contribute intellectually to at least one of the following: development of questions and overall study design, data analysis or interpretation, writing, or editing.\nSite PIs who contribute data but do not meet the criteria for co-authorship (e.g., submitting too few surveys, deciding to not make up for missing surveys with additional contributions (see criteria for authorship below, etc.) have two options for their data:\n\nThe Site PI will not be a co-author, but they agree to let HerbVar use and publish the data they contributed. They will be recognized via the HerbVar member list. The HerbVar member list will serve to acknowledge all contributors (even if they didn’t meet co-authorship criteria), and will be associated with each manuscript.\nThe Site PI will not be a co-author, and they do not agree to let HerbVar use and publish their data. All their data will be removed from all HerbVar databases. HerbVar will not use or publish their data. They will be removed from the HerbVar member list.\n\n\n\n7.3.2 “Working group” Papers\nWorking Group Papers allow for smaller teams to assemble to write additional papers using HerbVar data, broadening the scope of our collective work without requiring every lead author to manage hundreds of contributors. Typically, working group papers will be centered around already published HerbVar data analyzed in a new way and potentially combined with some new data. HerbVar supports working group paper authors in being as inclusive as is practical, and in connecting with appropriate co-authors to build new collaborations.\nIf an HerbVar member would like to lead an HerbVar working group paper (that is, serve as “lead author”), they should follow the steps below.\n\nRead the following authorship policies and guidelines.\nConsult the HerbVar website for current manuscript proposals and active manuscripts, and contact the listed lead author on any similar proposal to minimize overlap, or to join forces.\nDecide what approach you will use to form your working group and invite co-authors.\nPrepare a manuscript proposal, and email it to one of the memebers of the HerbVar Steering Committee. Your proposal should list:\n\nthe lead author(s)\nany other known authors\nplans for recruiting additional authors, if any - the title\nthe abstract\nthe specific types of data that you wish to use\nA brief overview of the response and predictor variables (if appropriate), and\na timeline for analysis and writing.\n\nProposed ideas are reviewed by the Steering Committee to ensure there is sufficient distinction from proposed and ongoing HerbVar papers. The Steering Committee may suggest altering or combining analyses and papers to resolve issues of overlap. After receiving Steering Committee Feedback, your proposal will be posted on the HerbVar website.\nRecruit co-authors as planned. Any invited co-authors should signal their intention to opt-in by responding by email to the lead author before the stated deadline. Lead authors are responsible for communicating regularly with co-authors about progress, including sharing drafts of analyses, figures, and text as often as is productive and practical.\nLead authors should create and use a GitHub repository for the paper in the HerbVar GitHub organization. This will allow the authors to use HerbVar tools for accessing data, for standardizing analyses and manuscript preparation, and for keeping track of co-authors. We ask that authors use our GitHub organization to store and share code and data within their team and with the HerbVar Steering Committee. This helps ensure reproducibility and provides a secure backup for all data, work, and products.\nLead authors and their working group should start work on the project within six months of the approval of their project proposal by the Steering Committee. If there are extenuating circumstances that delay the start of work, the lead author should communicate this to the Steering Committee. Extensions can be granted if needed but should be accompanied by a clear timeline.\nLead authors and their working groups should submit their paper to a journal within two years. If there are extenuating circumstances that delay paper submission, the lead author should communicate this to the Steering Committee. Extensions can be granted if needed but should be accompanied by a clear timeline.\nLead authors should circulate complete drafts among co-authors and consider comments and changes. Co-authors on papers with large numbers of authors should recognize the final decisions belong to the lead author, given that suggestions from co-authors may conflict.\nFinal manuscripts should be reviewed and approved by each co-author before submission.\nAll authors and co-authors should fill out their contribution in the authorship rubric and attach it as supplementary material to any HerbVar manuscript. Lead authors are responsible for ensuring consistency in credit given for contributions, and may alter co-author’s entries in the table to do so. An easy way to manage the author table is with an online spreadsheet. Note that the last author position may be appropriate to assign in some cases. For example, this would be appropriate for advisors of lead authors who are graduate students or postdocs and for papers that two people worked very closely to produce.\nThe lead author should carefully review the authorship contribution table to ensure that all authors have contributed at a level that warrants authorship and that contributions are consistently attributed among authors. Has each author made contributions in at least two areas in the authorship rubric? Did each author provide thoughtful, detailed feedback on the manuscript? Authors are encouraged to contact the HerbVar Steering Committee about any confusion or conflicts.\n\nWe encourage lead authors of working group papers to include as many co-authors as they can productively work with, to prioritize inviting HerbVar network members, and to prioritize inviting early-career scientists and scientists from under-represented groups or regions.\n\n7.3.2.1 Identifying & inviting potential co-authors of Working Group Papers\nHerbVar provides a tool to help lead authors identify potential co-authors to invite to assist with working group papers. All Site PI’s are asked if they would like to be included in a database of individuals interested in co-authorship on small-group papers. The database lists name, career stage, institution and location, areas of expertise and/or topics of particular interest, number of HerbVar papers or manuscripts this person is an author on, what HerbVar datasets they have contributed to, and a link to their website or google scholar page or researchgate page.\nNote that for any of the approaches listed below, authorship requires at least two types of contribution to a paper; see Qualifying for Authorship. The approaches for inviting co-authors listed below are on a continuum from least to most inclusive.\n\nTraditional. The lead author invites known individuals with value for the particular paper. These individuals may not necessarily be HerbVar members.\nTraditional Plus. The lead author invites known individuals with value for the particular paper, plus a few people chosen from the HerbVar database as a good match for this project.\nApplication-based. The lead author invites all HerbVar site PI’s who have contributed data to be used in the project to apply to be one of some limited number of authors, and chooses applicants to create the best team.\nOpt-in: Limited. The lead author decides on a number of co-authors they feel they can manage, and offers their paper to all HerbVar site PI’s who have contributed data to be used in this project on an “opt-in” basis. Site PI’s can opt-in until the desired number of collaborators is reached (first-come first-served).\nOpt-in: Open. The lead author offers their paper to all HerbVar site PI’s who have contributed data to this project on an opt-in basis. Any site PI who wants to participate is invited. If considering this approach, we suggest reading this paper about writing a massively multi-authored paper.\n\n\n\n7.3.2.2 Instructions for the Opt-in approaches\nThe following steps should be used to identify and invite authors for the Opt-in approaches.\n\nThe lead author uses the HerbVar co-author database to identifies site PIs who have contributed data to be used in this project.\nThe lead author circulates the manuscript proposal to the appropriate site PIs by attaching it as an email to the HerbVar email list. The subject line of the email should include the phrase “OPT-IN PAPER.” This email should also include a deadline by which time co-authors should respond.\n\nOnce individuals wishing to opt-in respond to the lead author, the lead author is responsible for working with all co-authors to organzie the process and timeline for completing the paper.\n\n\n7.3.2.3 When to invite co-authors\nThe right time to share your working draft and solicit co-authors is different for each manuscript, but in general:\n\nSharing early drafts or figures allows for more effective co-author contribution. This would mean inviting co-authors at a very early stage.\nCirculating almost-complete manuscripts does not allow the opportunity for meaningful contribution from co-authors, and is discouraged.\n\n\n\n7.3.2.4 Who should accept invitations to be a co-author?\nAuthorship must be earned through a substantial contribution. For co-authorship, each individual must contribute in at least two ways listed in the rubric below, including contribution to the writing process. Traditionally, project initiation and framing, data analysis and interpretation, and manuscript preparation are all authorship-worthy contributions, and remain so for HerbVar manuscripts. However, HerbVar collaborators have also agreed that contribution of data being used in a paper can be one factor qualifying a site PI for co-authorship, as long as the collaborator makes additional contributions to the particular manuscript, including data analysis, writing, or editing. HerbVar manuscripts will be accompanied by a supplemental table indicating authorship contributions. These guidelines apply equally to manuscripts led by graduate students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric item\nExample contributions counting towards authorship\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped and framed research question(s)\nOriginated idea for current analysis of HerbVar data; contributed significantly to framing the ideas in this analysis at early stage of manuscript\n\n\nAnalyzed data\nGenerated models (conceptual, statistical and/or mathematical), figures, tables, maps, etc.; generated a Network-scale dataset being used in this manuscript’s analysis\n\n\nContributed to data analyses\nProvided comments, suggestions, and code for data analysis\n\n\nWrote the paper\nWrote the majority of at least one of the sections of the paper\n\n\nContributed to paper writing\nProvided new text, help with organization framing, and provided citations linking to new literature areas\n\n\nSite PI\nCoordinated data collection, proofing, and submission of data for at least one site used in this manuscript\n\n\nNetwork level coordinators\nContributed substantially to network level activities such as management of network data, recruiting and assisting new sites, finding funding for network level management activities",

Each species is standardized within itself so studies of herbivory across a range of contexts allows for strong inference on the effects of those contexts.\n\n\n8.1.2 Objective 2: Novel species & contexts within focal families\nGoal: Sample species from novel clades or with atypical growth forms within our five focal families – Apocynaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Rubiaceae, and Solanaceae. Surveys of plant species that were included in Phase 1 are also welcomed but should prioritize novel regions, habitats, or environmental contexts.\nJustification: Increased resolution within our five focal families allows for testing of drivers of herbivory variability in a phylogenetically-explicit framework. Understanding the impact of evolutionary differences within these families on the distribution of damage will be crucial in teasing apart macroevolutionary patterns.\n\n\n8.1.3 Objective 3: Damage to Reproductive Tissues\nGoal: Survey damage to the fruits, flowers, and seeds of any species.\nJustification: Damage to reproductive structures has–arguably–the most direct impact on fitness so an understanding of the drivers of variation in herbivory damage to reproductive tissues is crucial for understanding population-level or fecundity-related consequences of herbivory variation.",

This is HerbVar’s Primary Survey Protocol. In brief, 30 randomly selected plant individuals in a site (~population) are surveyed for herbivore damage and (possibly) herbivore abundance. Data are also collected on the nearest conspecific neighbor of each plant (for a total of N = 60 plants). These methods yield estimates of variability, skew, and spatial patterns (e.g., autocorrelation) in herbivore damage.\nIf the Primary Protocol is not feasible for a species or site, then we suggest one of the alternative protocols. If none of these alternative protocols fits the situation, then collaborators may deviate from the primary protocol. We trust collaborators to decide how to adapt the primary protocol in ways that work for their systems. We suggest, however, that collaborators strive to follow the spirit of the protocol below: randomly select at least 30 plants from a site and census them and their nearest neighbors for herbivory and herbivore data. For a dataset to be usable in the overall study, it will have to be comparable to data collected using this protocol. Collaborators who deviate from the HerbVar protocols should carefully record their methods.",

    "section": "13.2 Preparing to Sample",
    "text": "13.2 Preparing to Sample\n\n13.2.1 Select a plant species\nFrom the patterns found in the first phase of data collection we have developed the following objectives going forward:\n\nSurveys of the three focal species (Taraxacum officinale, Plantago lanceolata, and Plantago major), especially across broad environmental and/or geographic ranges\nSurveys of species in the five focal families (Apocynaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Rubiaceae, and Solanaceae). We want surveys of new species within these families, especially species from new clades or with unusual growth forms. For repeat surveys of species within these families, we are prioritizing surveys from new regions, habitats, elevations, etc.\nSurveys of damage to any species’ reproductive tissues (e.g., flowers, fruits, etc.).\n\nWhile we welcome all surveys, data that fall under one or more of these three guidelines is particularly valuable in addressing the current scope of HerbVar’s research questions. Please refer to our more detailed HerbVar Species Selection Protocol for more information on species selection and how data contribution relates to authorship in papers utilizing those data.\n\n13.2.1.1 A note on the ideal abundance of focal plants\nThe primary protocol works best for sites with at least ~90 plant individuals, such that it makes sense to sample individuals randomly. If your site has fewer than ~90 individuals of your plant species, then please consider comprehensively censusing all individuals within the site as suggested in the Low Density/Abundance Protocol. A comprehensive census, when feasible, would be even better than the protocol below. If plants are far enough apart, please take GPS coordinates for each plant. If a comprehensive census is not feasible, then please modify the primary protocol or the low-density/low-abundance guidelines to work efficiently with your species and site. Please reach out to the HerbVar coordinators if you have questions or want to check that your modifications will lead to adequate data.\n\n\n\n13.2.2 Learn to Estimate Herbivory\nFirst, review HerbVar’s Damage Estimation Training Guidelines (see Chapter 14). Note that information on precision of estimates and acceptable binning is contained in this document This document contains valuable information on how to estimate percent damage on various leaves. Next, train and test team members with the ZAX Herbivory Trainer. This web-based application, created by Dr. Angela Moles and Zoe Xirocostas, provide a risk-free environment for testing oneself on per-leaf damage estimation Note that the app prompts you to assess damage to the nearest percent while our protocol is slightly coarser (see Table 14.1 of the Damage Estimation Guidelines). The app has two stages, one in which you assess damage and are immediately told how close you are to correct and a second where you assess 50 leaves, and the results are given to you at the end. Please feel free to focus on the first part of the app until you are confident (though you are of course welcome to do the second if you want extra training). Finally, download and familiarize yourself with the datasheets for this protocol. There are digital (see siteData, densityData, and plantData sheets) and printable versions to facilitate standardized data entry. If you have a question, feel free to reach out to herbvar@gmail.com.\n\n\n13.2.3 Site Selection & Delineation\nA “site” should be an area where a given plant species occurs at a high enough density to easily select 30 focal plants and 30 unique neighbors with our method. We can use any site anywhere around the world, but the most valuable sites will represent geographic regions, environmental conditions, habitats, or other ecological characteristics that we do not currently have in our database or that are currently poorly represented in our database. This is especially important for our focal species and re-surveys of other species we already have in our database. It’s less important for new species, especially when those new species are from clades that we do not currently have in the database.\nWe realize that defining the ‘edges’ of a site can be subjective and not easy. We search for an area where a given plant species occurs at a high enough density to easily select 30 focal plants and 30 unique neighbors with our method. This is usually a relatively dense patch. Walk around and see if you see the density drop off to well below the mean density that is used to calculate radius size. This is usually quite simple, e.g., when we walk out from the center of a “site” and don’t see any individuals of the focal species within 5 m, we decide we’re at the edge of a patch. In some systems, delineating a single, sampleable population simply might not be possible (e.g., where a species covers a vast area). In these cases, collaborators should simply do their best to select a reasonable, representative area to sample.\n\n\n13.2.4 Pick a time to sample\nThis will depend on the natural history of the system. We will accept data sampled at any time as long as there has been some herbivory. We will use the sampling date to examine how herbivory changes seasonally (please note approximate dates for beginning and end of growing season for each survey, see siteData sheet in datasheet template). However, the most valuable surveys will be after enough time has passed for an ecologically meaningful amount of herbivory to accumulate. In strongly seasonal systems, this will be in the latter half of the growing season. But it could also be once leaves have reached maturity (e.g., for species in which most herbivory is on expanding leaves). In other systems, the best time to sample might be during or after a key life history stage (e.g., flowering). All that said, there is no perfect time to sample. Collaborators should use their knowledge to decide when to sample (and sample when is feasible; some data is better than no data!). And repeat sampling is acceptable.\n\n\n13.2.5 Determine a radius for your circular quadrats\n\nIf you are sampling one of the HerbVar focal species (Taraxacum officinale, Plantago major, Plantago lanceolata): Use a radius of 0.4 m for your quadrats. This will standardize across surveys of these same species. Note that if your populations are sparse, you may use a larger radius following the other process or pre-calculated values (Table 13.1).\nIf you are using any other species, use the following process to determine a quadrat radius or use the table below:\n\nEstimate mean density of plants (plants per m\\(^2\\))\nCount the number of plants in 1 m\\(^2\\) at 10 random locations within the site\nCalculate mean plant density (D)\nUse D to calculate a circular quadrat radius (r) that would on average contain 4 plants r = 4/(πD).\nThis approach seeks an optimal, intermediate quadrat size that balances the costs associated with a small quadrat size (many empty quadrats) and a large quadrat size (quadrats that require counting many plant individuals).\n\nInstead of calculating as above, you may also use this pre-calculated set of radii (Table 13.1) for non-focal species. Remember, for focal species, please use 0.4 m\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.1: Table 1.

One random number represents distance along the transect (0–length of transect); the other represents distance left or right of the transect (left=negative, 0=center, right=positive). These are the center points of quadrats.\nFor each quadrat:\n\nLocate a quadrat center point using transect and measuring tape or stick (Figure 13.1)\nCount and record the number of focal plants within r meters of the center point (Figure 13.1).\n\nSee above for explanation of how to calculate r (or use values in Table 13.1).\nIt may be helpful to place a stick vertically in the center of the quadrat, attach a string of r meters to the tip, and walk in a circle around the stick to help visualize the circular quadrat\nNote: this includes only rooted focal plant species individuals in the quadrat\n\n\nRecord other quadrat-level data\n\nPercent cover of focal plant species (ignore non-focal species). Note: this includes both rooted and not rooted focal plant species individuals in the quadrat but hanging over the edge from above\nPercent cover of all non-focal plant species (ignore focal species)\n\nThese 2 percent covers could total more than 100% if they overlap\nIf surveying understory plants, ignore forest canopy when estimating percent cover\n\n\nIf the circular quadrat has 0 plants, record a zero and continue to the next quadrat\nIf the circular quadrat has &gt; 0 plants: Randomly choose 1 of the plants within the quadrat to survey A quicker alternative would be to choose the plant closest to the quadrat center. But this is recommended only if you think it will produce an unbiased sample of plants from your site. Be careful about over-representing large and/or isolated plants (which will be closer to more points relative to small plants in crowded patches).\nFor the selected plant (1 per quadrat) record plant life stage i.e., seedling, vegetative, flowering, fruiting Note that if multiple stages are present, record all relevant stages (i.e., a plant can be both flowering and fruiting)\nFor the selected plant record plant size. Use judgment to pick best measure for your species e.g., standing plant height (ground to tallest living part), stem length, foliage diameter, stem diameter\nPerhaps most importantly: for the selected plant record herbivore damage in 3 ways (see Damage Estimation Training Guidelines) Note that “herbivore damage” includes damage caused by both vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores.\n\nPresence/absence of leaf damage: Record both the total number of leaves on the plant and the number of leaves with &gt;0.5% herbivory\n\nIf the plant has ≤ 60 leaves total, please record the true numbers\nIf the plant has &gt;60 leaves total, randomly (arbitrarily) choose 60 and record those values. Please also make a note that you stopped at 60 (see template datasheet).\n\n\nNote that we are no longer including undamaged leaves in the following step, so these two data points are vital in understanding the proportion of the plant that is not damaged by herbivores.\nIf plants have reproductive parts (flowers/fruits/seeds) that could have been damaged by herbivores, please see the Reproductive Damage Protocol. This is optional but encouraged.\nEstimated percent damage on 10 randomly (arbitrarily) chosen leaves with herbivory damage (&gt; 0% herbivory)\n\nOne estimate per leaf (for a total of 10 estimates).\nPlease strive to sample in a way that selected leaves will be representative of all leaves on the plant (e.g., sample young and old leaves in proportion to frequency on plant)\nIf desired, you may use an application to estimate damage (e.g., LeafByte, etc.). However, please make a note of that in the appropriate part of the siteData tab of the template datasheet.\n\nNote that all selected leaves should have &gt; 0% damage (this is a change from the Phase 1 protocol). Note also that measuring only damaged leaves makes the data collected in step 1 (see above) vital in understanding per-plant damage variation.\n\nFor leaves with herbivore-built leaf shelters (rolls and ties), please carefully peer into or open shelters to estimate damaged area and count resident herbivores\nIf damage is estimated visually and leaves are visibly damaged but &lt; 0.5% (i.e., damage &gt; ~0.1% but ≤ 0.5%) record 0.5%. If a leaf has &lt; ~0.1% damage, round that down to zero. If using an app, make a note and put in the value the app provides.\n\nEstimated percent damage across the whole plant, optionally also breaking apart damage by type or even species of herbivore if possible (e.g., sucking damage versus chewing damage, add columns as needed).\n\nE.g., If a plant has 4 equally sized leaves and 2 of those leaves are 50% eaten, then whole plant has 25% herbivory\nBut take leaf size into account when leaves vary in size\nIf this measure is not feasible to collect, measure 30 leaves instead of 10 in step 2 (see above) and leave this blank. Those 30 can then be used to calculate this value post hoc\n\nRecord presence of plant diseases (i.e., pathogens)\nPlease also estimate your confidence in your pathogen estimate and include it as a note in the provided column in the datasheet. In Phase 1, several collaborators pointed out that the difference between pathogen pressure and nutrient deficiency can be slim so this confidence estimate will be helpful in accounting for the difficulty in pathogen estimation\nRecord number of leaf mines and galls per plant\n\nIf there is reason to believe that galls or mines have accumulated through multiple years (e.g., stem galls on woody perennials), please note this\nIf there are too many mines or galls to count individually, estimate the number per plant by tallying the number per module (e.g., stem, branch) and multiplying by number of modules\nIf serpentine/linear mines cannot be confidently recorded, instead count only blotch mines to record a consistent mine abundance (see visual guide at bottom of Herbivore Sampling Protocol for definitions of “serpentine” versus “blotch” mines)\nOptional: abundance of other externally-feeding herbivores (standardized approach; see Herbivore Sampling Protocol to decide if/how to collect these data)\n\nDistance to nearest conspecific neighbor (where the nearest neighbor is the plant with the closest above ground tissue to any aboveground tissue on the focal plant)\nData to record for the first nearest conspecific neighbor of selected plant: All the same data as focal plant except nothing for neighbor’s neighbor\nContinue visiting the randomly selected points until ≥ 30 focal plants and 30 nearest neighbors have been surveyed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: A diagram of the sampling scheme described in the text.

If you predict that many quadrats will be empty (e.g., in a very spatially clumped population of plants), then select more points (e.g., 60 points). (Remember the goal is to have 30 focal plants sampled, plus their nearest neighbors).\nSometimes, especially in small populations, a focal plant ends up being another focal plant’s neighbor. This is fine. Just note and keep going. If you have time, you can add an extra focal plant at the end (but this isn’t totally necessary).\nFor clonal plants, we have been calling stems “individuals” if they are not connected aboveground. When looking for above ground connections, we clear away detritus, but we do not dig or move soil. There is also a dedicated alternate protocol for surveying such species (see Rhizomatous Geophytes Protocol)\nPlease see our Damage Estimation Training Guidelines for guidelines on how to estimate herbivore damage. Here are two tips:\n\nSometimes discerning herbivore damage from physical damage (e.g., wind, trampling) is tricky. We do the best we can. We look at things like how jagged the cut edges are and if they travel past the missing area into the remaining leaf tissue (which would suggest the damage may have been physical).\nAnother challenge is old damage that occurred when leaves were still expanding. This could potentially make the area removed seem larger than it was. If we suspect something like this happened, then we try to bend the leaf back into shape to see if it seems like the missing area expanded over time.\n\nWe will accept surveys that only assess damage and do not identify herbivores. This will allow people without insect ID skills to participate in the study.",

If a garden was somehow stratified with blocks containing repeated instances of, e.g., different levels of leaf toughness, then damage distributions will not be comparable to damage from wild populations.

    "text": "14.1 Overview\nSo, you’ve figured out how to find the random set of plants to score damage on (e.g., using the Primary Protocol). Now it is time to look closely at each plant in order to score the amount of damage caused by herbivores. This is a task that will vary among plant species. This document is meant to guide you through the process of estimating herbivore damage using best practices that we have developed. Don’t fret that this document looks too long to follow for 60 plants per survey: we give an overabundance of pointers to cover likely hiccups that could occur across the world’s 400,000 plant species. Estimating herbivory will become second nature after you’ve familiarized yourself with the methods and had some practice. Ideally with these tips you should be estimating damage on a single plant in less than five minutes (and maybe a lot less!).\nIn this document, we provide detail for four key steps from the Primary Protocol:\nTwo related documents:\nObjectives: First off, it is good to keep in mind the goals of these estimates: Ideally, we would like to know (1) the total amount of plant material consumed by herbivores (e.g., grams of tissue eaten) and the (2) total amount of plant material remaining (e.g., grams of tissue remaining). Unfortunately, this is not feasible for most systems, so our goal is to approximate them by estimating (1) plant size and (2) percent removed by herbivores for entire plants and for a sample of leaves within plants.\nIf your species is a tree or large shrub, you have two options: First, we recommend most HerbVar collaborators restrict themselves to seedlings and saplings, which we define as ≤ 2 m in height. In this case, just ignore any individuals &gt; 2 m tall at your site, and follow the methods below. Make sure to note that you were excluding mature individuals. If you want to include mature trees (&gt; 2 m) in your survey, then please follow the HerbVar Tree Protocol (Chapter 18). The Tree Protocol describes a method for estimating herbivory on a subsample of leaves on each tree. However, after you’ve chosen your subsample of leaves, you will still have to estimate damage on each leaf, so the damage estimation tips and illustrated guides below will still be very helpful.\nIf your species is a cactus or other succulent, then please see the Cactus and Succulent Protocol (Chapter 17).\nIf your plants have reproductive tissues (flowers, fruits, seeds) and have had them long enough to potentially sustain herbivore damage, then please see the HerbVar Reproductive Damage Protocol (Chapter 15) for how to record this damage. The rest of this document focuses on damage to vegetative tissue.",

    "text": "14.2 Estimating Plant Size (and Determining What Tissue Counts)\nIn many cases, it will be clear what an individual plant is, but in cases of clonal plants, we will consider each ramet (i.e., above-ground unit) to be a unique “individual.” Move leaf litter to look for above-ground connections, but do not clear away soil.\nIn most cases, herbivores do not eat all plant biomass. Therefore, it will be useful to note the tissue that you are measuring damage on. For most HerbVar surveys, this will be vegetative tissue: “leaves” and maybe “stems.” The key is to collect your damage estimates across all of the tissue within a plant or on a random sample of the tissue within a plant. Before you start estimating damage, give some thought as to precisely what to include. For example, it is probably best to avoid senesced leaves (like the brown leaf of the Lepidium below) (perhaps unless the leaves were recently senesced such that they have not changed in size or distorted in any way). If you need to make any decisions about what to count, please remember to put detailed notes in the notes tab of the datasheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: Lepidium\n\n\n\nOnce you have decided the extent of plant you will be surveying, you can measure plant size. Because there are so many different plant growth forms, we suggest using your judgement to pick the best measure of plant size for your species. Examples of measures that work well for many species are standing plant height (e.g., ground to tallest living part), stem length (better than standing height for creeping species), foliage diameter, and stem diameter. Just make sure to be consistent within a survey, and to detail your plant size measure in the notes.",

    "text": "14.3 2. Counting Number of Total and Damaged Leaves (up to N = 60)\nThe first damage assessment step in the HerbVar Primary Survey Protocol is estimate the proportion of leaves with any damage, which we are defining as &gt; 0.5% of a leaf removed by herbivores. We estimate the proportion of leaves damaged by counting the number of undamaged and damaged leaves on each plant (recording total number of leaves and number of undamaged leaves) up to a max of 60 leaves per plant. See the following sections and illustrated guides below for tips on how to decide if a leaf has more than or less than 0.5% damage. Here we’ll discuss how to choose leaves to examine.\n\n14.3.1 Plants with small number of large leaves (N = 1-3)\nIf you have a plant that has a small number of large leaves (e.g., 1-3), then the proportion of leaves with damage is not going to be a very meaningful estimate of overall herbivory. In this case, consider counting leaflets (instead of leaves), if your plant has leaflets. Otherwise, proceed with leaves.\n\n\n14.3.2 Plants with &lt;60 leaves\nIf your plant has &lt; 60 leaves, we encourage you to quickly count and scan all of the leaves on the plant to look for the presence of herbivore damage. This will be easy on small plants and harder on large plants. Either way this step should take less than 2-3 mins. If it is too time-consuming to look at all the leaves on your plants or even up to 60 leaves (e.g., leaves are large or complex), then please pick a feasible number of leaves to subsample, ideally at least up to 30.\n\n\n14.3.3 Plants with &gt; 60 leaves\nIf you are restricted to examining a subsample of leaves within plants (because your plant have &gt; 60 leaves or because it would be too time-consuming to do all leaves, then you’ll have to decide how to subsamples leaves within plants. First, you will want to note the size of the subsample. Ideally you will have one number that will work for all plants in a survey. In that case, please detail this in the notes. If you need different subsample sizes for specific plants, please note subsample size in the notes for each plant, and please also make a note in the notes tab saying that you had to modify the number of leaves examined for some plants. Next you’ll need a way to subsample leaves more or less randomly within plants. If you need to subsample within plants, here are four potential methods:\n\n14.3.3.1 Subsampling Method 1: Nose-Pointing\nIan Pearse’s nose-pointing method: For large plants, I like to choose four positions around the plant roughly at the cardinal directions (this never comes out as neatly as I might like since a lot of plants just don’t grow that way). I stand at each of those positions, I turn away from the plant, I close my eyes, and I put my finger against my nose, like this (below). Then, I turn facing the plant, open one eye, and I choose whatever leaf I am pointing to (or the closest leaf if I’m pointing to multiple or none). I’ve done this on a lot for leaves, and I think it would basically work for other tissues (twigs, flowers, etc). You can continue to do this until you have examined your full subsample of leaves. Caveats: It is important to include mostly-eaten leaves using this method, but the method probably underestimates damage because you are less likely to be randomly pointing at a mostly-eaten leaf-nub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.2: {width=70%}\n\n\n\n\n\n14.3.3.2 Subsampling Method 2: True Randomization\nTrue randomization: Assign all leaves, seeds, etc. on the plant a random number, draw N numbers, and measure damage on those leaves. Caveats: this is rigorous, but probably too time consuming for most plants (and you’d probably just as well measure the damage on all the leaves you’ve given a number to!).\n\n\n14.3.3.3 Subsampling Method 3: Arbitrary Sampling\nArbitrary sampling. That sneaker-word, arbitrary! This is basically to say “I really tried to choose an unbiased sample of the plant tissue, but I have no idea whether or not I succeeded.” Caveats: Clearly, this can have problems, but it’s what we’re probably left with in most cases where plants have complicated architecture, the tissue is hard to choose in a more truly randomized way, or you’re just strapped for time.\n\n\n14.3.3.4 Subsampling Method 4: Define Your Own Method\nDesign (and make notes of!) your own subsampling scheme. Can you choose every seventh (or random-numberedth leaf along a shoot of skunkbush sumac (right)? Note how you did it, and approximately how much of the plant tissue you sampled (e.g., % of poison ivy sampled).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.3: legend needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophical thoughts about counting damaged leaves\n\n\n\nThis method works well (we think) as an estimate of overall herbivory for plants with small leaves or leaflets (e.g., sagebrush, Astragalus, locust), but will be very imprecise for plants with fewer, larger leaves because most large leaves will have some damage, though maybe not much. So, this is probably ineffective for your Welwitschia or banana tree. However, because counting a few large leaves is easy, we suggest doing it anyway for completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.4: legend needed",

    "text": "14.4 3. Estimating Percent Damage on 10 Randomly Chosen Leaves\nThe next damage assessment step is estimating percent damage on 10 randomly chosen leaves. Well actually, the 10 data columns for this step (percLf1–percLf10) come after the column for whole plant percent damage (percHerbPlant) in the HerbVar template datasheet, but it makes more sense, in this document, to discuss percent herbivory on individual leaves before discussing whole plant percent herbivory.\n\n14.4.1 Randomly choose 10 leaves:\nIf your plant has 10 or fewer leaves, then please examine them all; if your plant has more than 10 leaves, then use one of the methods above to choose 10 leaves randomly. Strive to have these leaves be an unbiased subsample of all the leaves on the plant.\n\n\n14.4.2 Estimate percent damage on each leaf\nFinally, the main event—this is probably the main reason you’re reading this document. There are many ways to estimate percent damage on leaves. For HerbVar, we recommend collaborators use visual estimation because other methods are slower and would make the sample sizes we need to describe herbivory distributions unattainable. Moreover, careful visual estimation does a surprisingly good job, especially after some practice, especially if the primary goal is to compare the frequency of plants with low and high herbivory, as ours is. However, we strongly recommend checking your estimates against estimates from other observers using the same method, or even better against estimates using digital methods (i.e., LeafByte) to get a sense for how good of a job you are doing, and if you are overestimating or underestimating.\n\n14.4.2.1 Visual estimation\nVisual estimation is essentially as simple as it sounds. You look at a leaf and eyeball what percent was removed or damaged by herbivores. The benefit of this method is that it is quick, allowing us to obtain the large sample sizes we need to describe whole herbivory distributions. The caveat is that this method has more measurement error than other methods. For example, Zoe and Julie and Marc Johnson have found that visual estimation tends to overestimate damage by a few percent, particularly for researchers with less experience. We hope to mitigate estimation error with the guidelines below, our Illustrated guide to amounts of percent damage, an online training quiz, and a ground-truthing effort. First we explain how to estimate damage. Second, we explain how to make sure you’re doing a good job.\n\nHow to estimate damage. Record estimates at a high resolution. We usually record at a resolution of 2.5% (Table 14.1). This may seem like unreasonably high resolution when you first try, but with a little practice and calibration you will get surprisingly good. We encourage trying for high resolution because—even with considerable error—high resolution estimates will likely be closer to the true values on average than estimates reported as broad categories (e.g., 0%, 1-10%, 11-25%, 26-50%… too coarse!). Plus, if you report your best guesses we can model the error statistically; we’re out of luck if you just report broad categories.\n\n\n\n\nTable 14.1: Recommended resolution for recording percent herbivory\n\n\n\n\n\nHerbivory (%)\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n0\nNo herbivory\n\n\n0.5\ntrace amount\n\n\n1\n~1 % herbivory\n\n\n2.5\n~2.5 % herbivory\n\n\n5\n~5 % herbivory\n\n\n7.5\n~7.5 % herbivory\n\n\n…\n…\n\n\n100\neverything removed except base of leaf petiole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first look at a leaf, do a quick mental calibration before estimating damage. We do this by visualizing cutting the leaf into a range of proportions. Start with large proportions and scale down to your finest resolution (e.g., 2.5%). For example, think about what half the leaf would look like, then imagine a quarter (25%) of the leaf. Do the same for a tenth of the leaf (10%): imagine 10 equally-sized divisions in the leaf. How big is each tenth? Then mentally cut each tenth in half to get 20 divisions of 5% leaf area. Finally, half of each of those units would be 2.5% leaf area. How big is that?\nWhen it is time to do the actual herbivory estimate, one strategy that works well for contiguous blocks of damage is to use fractional thinking to zero in on the precise value, starting with larger fractions and gradually working your way down to smaller fractions—honing from a coarse estimate to a precise estimate. For example,\n\nIf ~12.5% of a leaf were damaged, then…\n\nMentally cut the leaf into quarters\nSee that less than a quarter (25%) is damaged\nMentally cut the quarter with damage in half, yielding eighths (12.5%)\nSee that the area damaged is equal to an eighth and record 12.5%\n\nIf ~30% of a leaf were missing, then…\n\nMentaly cut the leaf in half\nSee that less than half is damaged\nMentally cut the leaf into quarters\nSee that more than a quarter (25%) is damaged\nTake mental note of the 25% damaged, and then focus on estimating how much more than that 25% is damaged\nMentally halve the quarter of the leaf with the excess damage above 25%, yielding eighths (12.5%)\nSee that the damage above 25% is a little less than half of one of those eighths, which means it’s a little less than a sixteenth or 6.25%\n25% plus a little less than 6.25% comes close to 30%, record it!\n\n\nIf your leaf has more than one area of damage, try mentally consolidating each area of damage into one area and then estimate the size of that using the method above. Alternatively, if mental consolidation isn’t working well, you can mentally divide the leaf into fractions that are as small as the smallest patch of herbivore damage. Then simply mentally tally the number of patches of that size that would be damaged.\nAn acetate grid can be a very helpful tool. Some people use them to help guide their estimates on every leaf. Others use them occasionally for validating and calibrating estimates (e.g., on the first few leaves estimated each day). To make one, simply print out a grid cell on a transparency (make sure it’s printer-friendly). Ian tends to print out several grid-sizes, and uses the size that has at least 20 grid cells for most leaves. Put the grid against the leaf. Count the number of grid cells with leaf (or where leaf should be) = T. Count the number of grid cells with damage = D. Percent damage is 100*D/T. If you have 40 grid cells per leaf, then each grid cell will be 2.5%, a good target resolution. If you only have 20 grid cells per leaf, you can count in units of half grid cells to obtain a finer resolution. Ian likes the grid method, as he can do it while on a ladder. It has the downsides of being hard on oddly-shaped leaves (where most grid cell readings are exterior), only estimating damage with a resolution of 1/T, and probably overestimating some damage types (like some beetle feeding) that may damage small parts of each grid cell.\nFor complexly pinnate leaves (e.g., Apiaceae), it is probably best to divide the leaf into leaflets or pairs of leaflets, then follow the methods above.\nIf damage is very high and very little leaf tissue remains, take a large and small leaf and compare the leaf base width, petiole and midrib size to compare. Use these comparisons to visually reconstruct the leaf, and deduce % damage from there\nIf you have marginal damage on leaves with non-smooth margins: If you draw an entire margin a third of the way between the base of the margin teeth and tip of the margin teeth, this approximately results in the same area measurement as if you had actually drawn in the margins—but it is easier/more accurate to imagine/draw a straight line than margin teeth\nPiercing-sucking damage, when visible, should be mentally consolidated and estimated similarly to chewing damage. Be careful about confusing piercing-sucking damage and disease because they often look similar. If you are unsure, sleuth around your site to see if you can find the culprit in action. Sometimes it helps to find leaves that have damage at different stages of progression. This will let you reconstruct what older more necrotic tissue (and less discernible) might have looked like before it became so necrotic, perhaps inferring the cause of the damage. If this doesn’t help, consult someone who may be able to or pick another species to survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.5: Legend Needed.\n\n\n\n\nFor leaves with herbivore-built leaf shelters (rolls and ties), please carefully peer into or open shelters to estimate damaged area and count resident herbivores.\nThrough all of this, make sure you are correctly identifying what is herbivore damage versus disease versus physical damage. Please have a look at our A field guide to types of plant damage. We are trying to avoid damage caused by pathogens or abiotic stress. Before each survey, spend some time studying the range of damage types on plants in your population. Try to get a sense for what types of damage you might see during the survey. Sleuth out what damage types might just be physical damage (e.g., from wind). In this sleuthing, we have found it helpful to search for clues at both broad and fine scales. At broad scales, we search many plants across each site to see if we can find what is causing a particular type of damage. Often we will find the culprit, but only after a broad search. At fine scales, we use a hand lens to look closely at the damage. Often, a closer look at the damaged edges of a leaf reveals marks from insect mandibles. Tearing, in contrast, tends to be cleaner and more angular, often following even small leaf veins. Wind damage can manifest as browning. Look to at damaged spots to see if any tissue is actually missing. Only include necrotic tissue as herbivory if you are certain it is from herbivory. If you cannot be confident in your ability to tell apart physical and herbivore damage for a particular species or site, then please do not do the survey or consult someone who can help you.\nFor internal feeding insects (e.g., hackberry psyllids, below):\n\nCount discrete units: count either the number of insects or the number of galls or mines. There are columns in the Template Datasheet for galls and mines.\nMines should be included in percent damage and counted as discrete units.\nGalls should only be counted, not included in percent damage because galls are actually extra tissue! The removed tissue is internal and can’t be seen.\nKeep an eye out for signs of stem-boring insects. Sometimes these can be counted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.6: Internal feeding insects\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4.2.2 How to make sure you’re doing a good job\n\nBe conscious that most people overestimate low levels of tissue damage (Johnson 2016). Try to correct for this by being aware of this tendency, not rounding up at low levels of damage, and calibrating/validating estimates on leaves with low damage.\nInvest time in practicing, calibrating, and validating estimates. Especially do this before collecting data, and continue to calibrate and validate regularly through data collection.\nStandardize among observers you work with or have a single observer for all estimates.\nPrint out An illustrated guide to amounts of percent damage. Study it while practicing, and take it into the field with you as a reference. You can focus on the pages with leaves that are most similar in shape to leaves from your species.\nTake our online herbivory estimation training quiz (in development, we will add the link here when it’s ready). This will help you assess your accuracy and precision and give you additional practice in estimating herbivory. We suggest re-taking this quiz once per week when doing surveys to refresh your memory.\nFinally, ground truth a subset of your damage estimates using a digital method. When doing this, please use 6 randomly selected plants in each survey. Do the survey as normal, but after visually estimating herbivory on each leaf in those plants use one of the two digital methods below to get a digital herbivory estimate (LeafByte or ImageJ). Make sure to record a unique identifier for each leaf to link visual and digital estimates.\n\nLeafByte: This is an app developed recently by scientists at Cornell (including our very own Zoe Getman-Pickering and Julie Davis). It goes on your iPhone and estimates damage of leaves that you photograph (it will tell you total leaf area, total damage area, and proportional damage). You can download the app and read instructions here. ‘BioLeaf’ is a similar app for Android phones.\nScan leaves and estimate damage with Image J. For this, I usually collect leaves into a little bag. Once I’m back in the lab, I tape the leaves to a sheet of paper, and then use Image J (free software here) to estimate leaf damage. This is similar to LeafByte, but it takes longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.7: Three steps in measuring damage with Image J.",

    "section": "14.5 4. Estimating Percent Damage Across the Whole Plant",
    "text": "14.5 4. Estimating Percent Damage Across the Whole Plant\nThe final damage assessment step is estimating percent damage across the whole plant, or as much of the plant as is feasible. We encourage you to strive to look across entire plants when estimating whole plant herbivory (unless your plants are &gt; 2 m in height, in which case please follow the HerbVar Tree Protocol). For larger plants, there will be significant estimation error, but it is probably less than the error associated with subsampling, which could miss hotspots of herbivory within plants. Remember, the goal is just a visual estimate. You’d be surprised how quickly you can scan and integrate across a whole plant to estimate herbivory. However, we acknowledge this may not be feasible for large or complex plants; in those cases, please use one of the subsampling methods above and remember to record your methods and the size of your subsample. If you don’t feel that a whole-plant estimate is feasible, record the percent damage on 30 random leaves (see #3 above) and carefully record the total number of leaves on the plant and number of damaged leaves on the plant. The whole plant herbivory can be calculated from these values post hoc.\n\n14.5.1 Tips for visually estimating damage across the whole plant:\nEffective methods will vary a lot based on the size of plants, size of leaves, and architecture of plant. For smaller plants with a smaller number of leaves, you can quickly estimate damage on each leaf and combine leaf-level estimates into a plant-level estimate. If all leaves are similar in size, you can just average them. If leaves vary in size, you will need to take their relative sizes into account.\nWe often find it helpful to pick a reference leaf size on which to base mental calculations. Often it’s convenient to pick the largest or smallest leaf, depending on whether you prefer scaling down or scaling up leaf level estimates.\nAn important tip to remember for speed is that when plants have more than ~9 leaves, leaves with low levels of damage will contribute very little to plant-level damage. For example, a leaf with 2% damage would only contribute 0.2% to overall plant damage on a plant with 10 similarly sized leaves. This means that you do not need to stress about these leaves. Of course, if every leaf on the plant has 2% damage, then this would be important to keep track off. Indeed, this is essentially what you need to pay attention to as you scan the whole plant. In our experience, most plants have skewed distributions of herbivory within plants, so it’s all about paying attention to the proportion of leaves with insignificant and significant herbivory and the amount of herbivory on leaves with significant herbivory. But this isn’t always the case, so look out for more even within-plant distributions. (Side note: we hope to get at this question with our herbivory estimates on the 10 random leaves). For larger plants and plants with many small leaves, it is impractical to scan each individual leaf and mentally combine them (unless you are a mental math wizard!). In these cases, we still encourage you to scan the whole plant, but simply increase the grain size of your focus. For example, estimate herbivory at the scale of similarly sized branches of leaves. For plants with many, many small leaves, you may need to squint and look at similarly sized clumps of leaves. For example, people who work on conifers have a method for estimating herbivory on branches that involves looking up through a branch and seeing how much sky shows through.\nPlease let us know if you have additional tips, suggestions, or guidelines we can add to this document. And please let us know if anything is missing, confusing, or wrong! Have fun in the field and be safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you’re in an area with tick-borne diseases, don’t forget to check for ticks after!",

Each individual plant should produce enough flowers/fruits/seeds so that you can survey between 15-30 reproductive units per plant. These ‘units’ could be flowers, fruits, or seeds, whichever will give you enough things to count.\nC. Most of the plants should be in a similar phenological stage. If there is a mixture of flowering and fruiting plants within the population, it might be difficult to get a large enough sample size for one organ type. Additionally, different phenological stages will likely be attacked by different insects\nD. If your plant does not meet these requirements, please skip measuring damage to reproductive organs.

Ideally at least 30 reproductive units will be examined per plant. For plants that have much more than 30 units, examine a haphazard subsample of 30 units per plant. These should be sampled from different parts of the plant to obtain a good representative sample of damage levels to the plant. Damage measurements will be highly variable among species, depending on the types of flowers or fruits produced as well as the type of damage that is most common in the population. Below we give some general guidelines.\nG. There likely will need to be modifications for some species, but we trust collaborators to do the best they can in their systems while maintaining the overall spirit of the protocol. For example, if your species has only one or a few flowers/fruit, you can estimate the damage as a percentage. Keep in mind that the goal is to capture the variability in damage rates among plants within a population, so you will want to choose a measure of flower/fruit/seed damage that best captures this variability.",

Look for damage by insects that may chew on developing flowers (e.g. katydids, beetles), insects that bore into flower heads or seeds (e.g. larval weevils, leps, or flies), or true bugs that may probe/pierce into the seeds or fruits (looks like little black dots on the fruits). In many cases you will need to tear open the seed head/fruit to look for boring insects inside the seeds/fruit.\nLook for signs of chewing damage inside the fruit, such as destroyed seeds and insect frass.\nThe best measurements of damage will depend on the type and extent of damage present. If the plant species experiences damage to multiple organs (e.g., petals, stamens, etc.), focus on the damage to the primary reproductive parts if it is not feasible to measure multiple organs.\nIn the “reproUnit” column of the reproData sheet in the template Excel datasheet, please record what organs you are recording damage on (e.g., stamens, petals for flowers). If present and identifiable, record the number and identity of the florivore, frugivore, seed predator\nIf your species has only one or a few flowers per plant and it’s possible to record the percent damage to a flower or fruit, you can record these percent damages in the percR# columns. 15 such columns are provided but please add more if you are able to record the per-unit damage of more than 15 reproductive structures\nIndicate whether you are recording ‘count’ or ‘percent’ damage in the ‘damageUnit’ column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Example reproData information\n\n\n\nNote 1: numReproHerb can be less than the sum of the counts of types of damage because a single reproductive unit can have multiple types of damage.\nNote 2: In the damageUnit column, record ‘count’ or ‘percent’ depending on whether you are recording the number of damage reproductive units or the percent damage to a single unit\n\n\n15.1.2 Examples of different types of damage to reproductive material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Abronia umbellata with chewing damage to two corolla (one is completely chewed and one is partially chewed).

The Primary Protocol was designed to work for many plant species, growth forms, and contexts, but it requires sites with enough focal plants at a reasonably high density for efficient random sampling using our transect/sub-transect method. If the focal plants at your site are at very low density, then sampling them with our primary method will be very time-consuming due to the large distances between plants. If they are at low abundance, such that there are fewer than about ~90 plants in the site, then it does not make sense to draw a random sample of 30 plants + 30 neighbors from such a small population. If none of the methods below work well for your species and site, we encourage you to think of a comparable alternative. Feel free to get in touch if you have questions. Regardless of what you decide, please make sure to carefully document your methods.",

    "section": "16.2 Protocols",
    "text": "16.2 Protocols\nWe provide three separate protocols for surveying sites with low density and/or abundance of focal plants: (1) Comprehensive Patch Census, (2) Walking Transect, (3) Comprehensive Census of Subset.\n\n16.2.1 Option 1 – Comprehensive Patch Census\nThe best method, when feasible, is to census all of the individuals in a patch. This will work when there is a well-defined patch with a reasonable number of plants (e.g., &lt; ~90). If this is possible, it is better in many ways than the Primary Protocol because it describes the whole distribution of herbivory at the site—there’s no risk of missing the tails of the distribution if every plant has been included! Also, depending on the context, this could be faster than our Primary Protocol because setting up transects and quadrats to randomly sample plants is time consuming. So comprehensively examining all of a patch’s 90 plants, for example, might be faster than randomly sampling 60 plants (30 focal plants and their 30 neighbors) from a larger population. For this method, we stress that you should strive to survey every plant.\nRecord spatial information via one of two methods:\n\nOption 1A - Record GPS position of each plant: If you do this, you will not need to record nearest neighbor information because we can reconstruct it (and more!) easily from the geographic coordinates. This of course means that you will need a GPS sensitive enough to differentiate the locations of your plants. If your plants are on average more than 2-3 m apart, then almost any modern GPS will be precise enough. If, however, your plants average less than ~1 m apart, then you would need a very precise GPS to describe the relative locations accurately. If you don’t have such a precise GPS (or if you don’t like how slow a precise GPS can be), we recommend the second method.\nOption 1B - Relative spatial coordinates:  You can measure the relative coordinates of your plants using two tape measures or a tape measure and a meter stick. This sounds similar to the primary protocol but it’s much quicker because you’re not using the tapes to select plants, just to record their locations.\n\nLay a tape measure through your patch. For each plant, record spatial coordinates as how far along the tape measure and how far from the tape measure. You can situate the tape either along the edge of the patch or through the middle of the patch.\nIf your tape measure is through the middle of the patch, remember to record the distance left of the tape as negative and right of the tape as positive. The start of your tape will have the coordinate (0,0).\nAfter recording this information, follow the Primary Protocol as closely as possible\n\n\nOther useful information\n\nRecord popDiameter1 and popDiameter2 as the approximate extents of your patch/census area\nFor focal plant percent cover (focalPlantCover) and non-focal plant percent cover (otherPlantCover), please follow the Primary Protocol methods for estimating population density and calculating a quadrat radius size, if feasible. You can then center a quadrat on each focal plant in the census to define an area around each focal plant for recording focal and non-focal percent cover, as well as the number of focal plants in quadrat (numPlantsinQuad).\nIn comprehensive surveys the ~60 plants will all be focal plants and there is no random selection; hence the nearest neighbors (all the “.1” plant IDs in datasheet template) become focal plants. As described above, a quadrat is centered around each plant and the three quadrat-level variables (focalPlantCover, otherPlantCover, and numPlantsinQuad) are recorded for each plant. The nearest neighbor distance (NNdist) is still recorded, but since that neighbor is treated as a focal plant, please record the unique plantID of that nearest neighbor as well (e.g. add NNplantID column as needed in datasheet).\nIf you cannot estimate population density (e.g., because your species is too sparse), then please pick an arbitrary quadrat radius. You can use that to define an area around each focal plant in your census for estimating percent cover variables. A 1-m radius might be a good choice for many plants, but go bigger for bigger plants. Remember to record your choice!\n\n\n\n16.2.2 Option 2 – Walking Transect\nAnother alternative if you have widely dispersed plants that do not form a well-defined patch (or the patch is too large for a comprehensive search) is a walking transect.\n\nRandomly pick distances (e.g., paces) along a transect and from a transect.\nPace out the distance along the transect, then turn orthogonally to pace out the distance from the transect.\nSurvey the closest plant within some reasonable distance (if no plant is reasonably close, then go back to transect and keep going).\nRepeat until you have 30 plants and 30 neighbors.\n\nThis is similar to the Primary Protocol except pacing (rather than measuring with a tape) can make large areas more feasible to survey. Consider recording spatial coordinates for each plant, especially if plants are far from your randomly identified points. And try to survey neighbors for each plant.\n\n\n16.2.3 Option 3 – Comprehensive Census of Subset\nThis method is similar to the comprehensive census of a patch (#1 above), but it applies when there is no well-defined patch and individuals are widely dispersed over a large area. There are two ways to do this but for both of these methods, record spatial coordinates for each plant and see other notes for method #1 above.\n\nOption 3A - Comprehensive survey of all plants along a transect: With this method, you are doing a comprehensive survey of a linear subset of the whole population\n\nStart by randomly picking a transect starting point and direction\nWalk the transect and survey every plant that crosses your path or every plant within a reasonable distance of your path (e.g., 2 m)\nKeep going until you get at least 60 plants\n\nOption 3B: Comprehensive survey radiating out from a random starting point within a population.  With this method, you are doing a comprehensive survey of a roughly circular (or blobby) area within the whole population. The cons of this approach are that if your plants are close together there could be high spatial autocorrelation such that you fail to capture the range of herbivory levels in the population. Of course, this is always a risk; it’s just especially acute when the sampling extent is an arbitrary area rather than a biologically significant “patch’’.\n\nExplore outwards from your random starting point, surveying every plant you encounter until you get to at least 60 plants. We do not recommend doing this unless your plants truly are all widely dispersed.",

There are at least five categories, each with its own herbivory sampling issues Single, unbranched tube stuck in the ground (e.g., in the American Southwest, a barrel or a pincushion cactus). As they age, they get taller and wider, but they never branch or clone. If there is a cluster, they are genetically different from each other (I am almost sure, JB).\nEntire structure should be scrutinized for herbivore damage. When these cacti form a cluster, they should be categorized as multiple individuals rather than as a single individual.\nSet of unbranched tubes connected underground (e.g., a hedgehog cactus (small), or a senita or organ pipe cactus (large)). They add units as they age.\nEither the whole thing can be scrutinized for damage, or a subset of units could be (please make a note of which path you chose). If there are not that many units, full sampling is possible. However, some of these cacti get very tall. Since much damage seems to accrue at tube tips, one really should look at the entire length. Tube that starts to branch above the ground as it ages (e.g., a saguaro cactus).\nSame method as #2 (again, please make a note of whether you examined the whole plant or a subset of units).\nLarge set of tubes connected at distinct joints (e.g., a cholla cactus). New tubes are added as the plant ages.\nSubsampling within individuals will usually be necessary because individuals often have many tubes. Our protocol below, which is focused on cacti with many joints, describes a method for subsampling up to 20 joints per plant.\nLarge set of tubes connected at distinct joints but flattened into pancakes (e.g., a prickly pear cactus).

So if this category is being surveyed, special attention should be paid to the edges of pads. I am not sure if it will be evident, or at least common, for any other category: only this category consists of units with “edges”. I suspect that other cactus-feeders that take out chunks of flesh concentrate on the youngest tissue (new units and the tips of existing units), and this suggests important sampling rules: young units should be sampled, as well as tips of existing units (which, unfortunately, might be very high in the air). Some large beetles burrow into cactus flesh, but (based on my knowledge of barrel cactus) these individuals rapidly die, so this sort of damage is unlikely to persist\nScarring of the surface of the cactus.\nIt can be very hard to know what causes this – some of this damage may be attributable to herbivores, but some might be fungal or bacterial attack. It is worth taking photos of the damage and trying to figure out the culprit. Damage left by various small herbivores on various cactus species has been described in the literature and it may be worth making a photo album for later identification.\nColonies of sucking insects.\nIn particular, cochineal bugs live in colonies and are exciting to see. They are covered with a messy white wax. At least in the desert Southwest, cochineal are primarily found on introduced Opuntia ficus-indica. However, there are small colonies on Opuntia englemanii as well that should be watched out for.",

On the other hand, I don’t know of any hedgehog or pincushion cacti that have them. Ant attraction to extrafloral nectaries may reduce herbivore attack, though field evidence for this has varied across cactus species, and ants are often surprisingly rare. Most EFN-bearing cacti only secrete nectar when there is new vegetative growth, buds, flowers, and early fruit present, but some (such as the fishhook barrel cactus abundant in Tucson) secrete it year-round.\nIt seems likely that the newest, tenderest units (particularly in categories 4 and 5 cacti) are particularly likely to be attacked.\nThe buds and young fruits of some cacti get very heavily attacked, and these should be included by counting damaged and undamaged units and recording the data separately (see Reproductive Damage Protocol).",

By young pads we mean those that are final joints, i.e., that don’t have another pad growing out of them. Problems with older pads include: Older pads can be many years old, thus integrating herbivory over a much longer time than happens for other plant species in HerbVar (few plants hold leaves as long as cacti hold their pads)\nPractically, it’s very hard to determine and quantify what is herbivory vs physical damage on older pads Physically, it can be hard and dangerous to access older pads on spiny plants!\nIf you think focusing on young pads will not be good for your species, then please modify the protocol to include older pads.

Past populations we surveyed had many very large clumps of pads that were almost certainly one plant individual, though not all connections were visible aboveground. In most cases, the clumps were discrete enough that we were confident each clump was one individual with below ground connections.\nSee above discussion of architectural categories of cacti/succulents\nIf you have a site with &gt;90 plant individuals, follow the Primary Protocol from the beginning until you have your first plant for herbivory estimation. Briefly:\nPick transect and subtransect distances that will encompass your site and lay the transect through the site. Estimate the density of plants in the population.\nUse the estimated plant density to calculate a quadrat radius to use for the survey.\nRandomly generate x,y points, visit them, and set up a quadrat centered on each random point, selecting 1 plant randomly within each quadrat. See the Primary Protocol for more detail.\nOnce the first plant is selected, survey it for herbivory. For vegetative herbivory, we recommend focusing only on terminal pads (see #4 above). Terminal pads are those at the end of a branching structure, without another pad growing out of them. Also, focus only on the visible surfaces of pads because moving spiny pads safely is difficult and time consuming! Record herbivory from all organisms in one column and herbivory you are certain was just from insects in a second column. We found it was difficult to distinguish insect herbivory from vertebrate herbivory, so we usually recorded “totalHerb” Occasionally it was clear some herbivory was just from insects, so then we used the “insectHerb” column to indicate what percent was definitely from insects. There are 3-4 herbivory estimation steps, depending if your plant has reproductive organs: Quickly scan all of the terminal pads across the entire plant and visually estimate percent herbivory. This is a quick estimate, but it’s important to scan the whole plant because herbivory can be patchy within plants.\nRandomly select 20 of the terminal pads. Record the number of pads you examined and the number with any herbivory present. If there are fewer than 20 pads on the plant, then do all pads.\nRandomly select 10 terminal pads, and record a visual estimate of the percent herbivory on each pad, resulting in 10 numbers (one number for each of the 10 pads). We estimated percent herbivory as surface area removed on the visible faces of paddles (as opposed to volume or doubling the area for holes that went entirely through a paddle).\nIf your plant has reproductive organs, please randomly (arbitrarily) select up to 20 units of one type (e.g., flowers or fruits) and record the number of units you examined and the number that were damaged (&gt;0.5%).

Therefore, we want to include enough surveys of mature trees in HerbVar’s global sampling to allow us to compare patterns between trees and other growth forms. It is also important to include mature trees because there may be major shifts in tree-herbivore interactions with tree ontogeny, from seedling to sapling and sapling to adult.",

    "text": "18.4 Protocol – Mature Trees\nFollow the Primary Protocol & Site Selection Protocol to pick a site, set up a transect, and randomly select focal trees or quadrats. Many tree species cover huge geographic areas, making it unreasonable to survey an entire “population” or define a discrete study “site.” If you are working with a widespread species, it is fine to choose a “representative” study area, which actually might just be a small part of a large stand of trees.\nOnce you have selected a representative study area, you will need to randomly select 30 trees to survey (plus their nearest conspecific neighbors). There are many ways to do this. Here are three methods in somewhat decreasing order of amount of work and rigor:\nFollow the Primary Protocol exactly, establishing a transect, selecting 30 points randomly (distance along main transect and distance from main transect), and using a circular quadrat at each point to randomly select 1 individual of the tree species within the quadrat (as in the Primary Protocol). Survey each selected tree and its nearest neighbor.\nFollow the Primary Protocol except skip the circular quadrat step, which could need to be prohibitively large in some tree populations: Establish a transect and randomly select 30 points (distance along main transect and distance from main transect). Then select and survey the individual nearest to each random point (plus nearest neighbor).\nFor trees that are at low density or low abundance, please consult our Low Density Protocol to select trees. For low-abundance plants, we recommend surveying every plant within some area. Take GPS coordinates for each plant. Try to get as close to 60 plants as possible. If you are taking GPS coordinates for each plant, then you do not need to measure distances to nearest neighbors because we can measure spatial relationships using the GPS data.\nHowever you select trees, please make sure to take detailed notes on what you did\nNote that some of the trees you select may be seedlings or saplings. We recommend doing whichever individual you randomly select, regardless of its age. This should yield a representative sample of all individuals at the site, across age classes\nRandomly select 30 leaves for quantitative estimates of percent herbivory on each of the 30 leaves See Primary Protocol and Damage Estimation Training Document for guidelines on quantifying percent herbivory per leaf\nPlease also record the number of galls, mines, and other discrete damage types. Note that mines should be included both in percent damage (because they represent damaged surface area) and as counts.\nRandomly select an additional 30 leaves to score for presence/absence of herbivory. Record the number out of 30 with herbivory.\nDo not worry about estimating herbivory at the whole-plant scale for mature trees; we will estimate this using the 30 presence/absence leaves and the 30 percent herbivory leaves",

We provide some guidelines below, but you should choose an approach that makes sense for you and your species.

Here are two alternate methods for selecting random (or at least haphazard) leaves\nThe easiest method: if it would work for your trees, is to close your eyes, point at the tree, open your eyes, and take the leaf you were pointing at (“Ian’s nose pointing method” in the Damage Estimation Training Document).\nPerhaps the most rigorous but most time-consuming method:  is to haphazardly strip several times as many leaves as you need (e.g., &gt;200 leaves). Place leaves individually into a large bag. Mix them. Close your eyes and draw 30 leaves for percent herbivory and 30 leaves for presence/absence of herbivory.",

If not, prioritize another herbivory survey (see the Primary Protocol).\n\nGrasshoppers/crickets/katydids (Orthoptera).\nCaterpillar-like larvae (i.e., eruciform larvae). Note: this includes moth/butterfly caterpillars, sawfly (Hymenoptera: Symphyta) larvae, and some beetle larvae but does not include larval true flies (i.e., maggots)\nAphids (Aphididae)\nHoppers (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha). This includes planthoppers (Fulgoromorpha), leafhoppers (Cicadellidae/Cercopidae), treehoppers (Membracidae), & cicadas (Cicadidae). If you are confident, you may also identify non-”hopper” Auchenorrhynchans in the column provided in the template Excel file\nNon-Aphid Sternorrhynchans. This includes whiteflies, scale insects, and mealybugs\n\nAre you confident that you can visually detect the herbivores on the selected plant species, considering the complexity of plant structure? If not, prioritize another herbivory survey (see the Primary Protocol). If you have the ability to sample herbivores in another way (e.g., a beat-sheet) and feel excited about this, feel free – but be judicious of the added time required for sorting through a loaded beat-sheet!\nCould you do another herbivory survey with the time required to conduct an herbivore survey? If yes, prioritize another herbivory survey (see the Primary Protocol). If not, please collect herbivore data!\n\n\n\n20.2.2 Sampling insects beyond “core” herbivores.\n\nIn an effort to standardize the insect data we have included 5 groupings to use for tallying herbivores. This is to avoid counting insects which may be predatory, rather than herbivorous (e.g., “true bugs”). Please prioritize counting herbivores belonging to the 5 aforementioned groups (see visual guide below if needed).\nPlease indicate whether you are recording herbivores as a count or as presence/absence data (see “insectUnit” in the “herbivoreData” tab of the template Excel file)\nFor both core and non-core insects, please herbivorous count insects whether or not they are actively feeding. You are welcome to make a note of their behavior in the “notes” column but all potential herbivores on the plant should be included in your survey\nIf you have more intimate knowledge of insect herbivores (e.g., can distinguish herbivorous true bugs from predatory), please add columns for these other insects in the “herbivoreData” tab of the template Excel file.\n\nTo facilitate this, we have added “beetleHerbivore”, “thysanopteraHerbivore”, “gastropod”, “stemBorers”, and “heteropteraHerbivore” to the template digital datasheet but you are welcome to add other columns as needed.\nWe also recognize that herbivore surveys may differ dramatically among sampling sites and have modified our printable datasheet for this survey to include an “Insect ID” column rather than predefined columns\n\nPlease continue to record the 5 required insects (even when there are none please put a zero)\n\nWhile mines/galls are recorded in the Primary Protocol, mine-/gall-forming insects should be counted here if you have the time and identification ability to search within galls/mines for insects",

Center = multiple mines\n\n\n\nHow do you count multiple mines? It’s a confusing picture but in that way is more likely something that would be seen in the field! One of our gall gurus (Eric LoPresti) thinks this is probably two mines. He says, “the one that terminates at the top in a blotch and the one that terminates at the bottom center in a wider figure 8 - looks confusing since the bottom one doubled back, making a weird hanging trail. But you can tell that it is a single mine, since there is no nearby really thin trail where it starts. The intermediate width mine on the right is odd - whether it was aborted/eaten or doubled back is not obvious to me, however, I suspect it is the latter, as I only see two really thin sections, both on the upper half, which indicates a start and a very small caterpillar.”\nThis can get confusing, but do your best. Each count doesn’t have to be exactly right; we should still be able to get a representative count of the distribution of damage & mine frequencies. If in doubt with these serpentine mines, standardize by counting only the blotchy/expanded mine ends; this will ignore (but in a consistent way) aborted or re-started mines. Make a note of this in the data if you choose this method.\n\n\n20.3.2 Leaf Mines – Blotch Mines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.2: Several examples of multiple blotch mines on single leaves\n\n\n\n\n\n20.3.3 Galls – Leaf Galls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.3: Leaf Galls\n\n\n\n\n\n20.3.4 Galls – Stem/Branch Galls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.4: Stem/Branch Galls",

    "text": "23.2 How to Edit the Manual\n\n23.2.1 Getting Started\nQuarto is the next-generation of R Markdown. Like R Markdown it allows for rendering files in multiple formats (.pdf,.docx., .html) and it can be used to make websites, reports, and presentations, but it has the advantage of being able to run embeded code chunks in multiple languages (e.g., R, Python) and allowing users to execute code (i.e., for demonstrations) in the rendered quarto file. Users of Markdown / R Markown will recognize the structure and format of quarto files (.qmd), and the content of R Markdown files can be executed in .qmd files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA tutorial on getting started with Quarto and RStudio can be found here. Posit (née ‘R Studio’) has also prepared an excellent Quarto Cheatsheet that will prove very helpful.\n\n\nTo edit the manual you will need a Github account and RStudio. The process for editing the Manual is:\n\nInstall the quarto package\nFork the Herbvar Manual’s Repository and clone it into your personal Github\nEdit files (or create a new ones)\nCommit and push the changes\nSubmit a pull request with your suggested edits\n\nStep 1. Open R Studio and install the quarto package using either the ‘install’ button on Rstudio or by executing the following command.\n\n\nfrom the R Studio Command Line\n\ninstall.packages(\"quarto\")\n\nStep 2. Fork the repository for the HerbVar Manual [repo link] from the HerbVar Organization Github into your personal Github account (tutorials here and here).\nStep 3: Edit files (or create a new ones). You can format your text using markdown syntax (see this cheetsheet), but if you would prefer to edit text and simply leave formatting notes (e.g., “bold this”, species names in italics”) that’s fine too.\nStep 4: Commit and push the changes using RStudio (or the command line if you feel the need to flex).\nStep 5: Submit a pull request so the Manual’s ‘Administrators’ can review and incorporate your suggested edits. (tutorials: how to submit a pull request from a forked repo here, general introduction here and here.)",

    "text": "23.3 Publishing the Manual (Admins Only)\nThe admins of the repo can publish the book in HTML (to a Github pages site) and as a pdf (on the repo). There are three ways for a Admin to publish Quarto documents to GitHub Pages(see here):\n\nRender sites on their local machine to the docs directory, check the rendered site into GitHub, and then configure the GitHub repo to publish from the docs directory.\nRender on their local machine and then use the quarto publish command to publish content rendered on the local machine.\nUse a GitHub Action to automatically render files (a single Quarto document or a Quarto project) and publish the resulting content whenever a source code change (e.g., any edit of the manual) is pushed to the repository.\n\nWe are currently using Github Actions to automatically render and publish any time a change to the manual is committed and pushed to Github. However, if there is ever an issue with gh-action, or if you want to try the manual way of rendering/publishing, you can do the following: (1) Use the quarto render command from the Terminal to render all output formats (the output of your book will be written to the _book sub-directory of your book project), then (2) use the quarto publish gh-pages command to publish the locally rendered content online (more detailed instructions can be found here).\nRendering the manual:\n\n\nfrom the Terminal\n\nquarto render\n\nNote that if you pass no arguments to quarto render as above, all formats will be rendered. You can instead render individual formats via the –to argument:\n\n\nfrom the Terminal\n\n\nquarto render           # render all formats\nquarto render --to pdf  # render PDF format only\n\nPublishing the manual:\n\n\nfrom the Terminal\n\nquarto publish gh-pages",

    "section": "25.2 Updating the Portal",
    "text": "25.2 Updating the Portal\nIt may become necessary to edit the portal, especially if a user emails you indicating they had a problem and it seems like that problem is inside of the app rather than (not to be mean) user error.\n\nAll of the portal code is in the “Data-Portal” GitHub repository (link)\n\nThe script from which the portal is created is called “app. R” and is the only file in the folder “Data Portal Actual”\nYou will also need the “deployment-faq. R” script in the “Support Scripts” folder in order to deploy the app after you have made/tested any changes to the portal’s code. i. If it is of interest, the “Support Scripts” folder also includes my (Nick’s) incremental forays into the world of Shiny so you can see the first through eighth versions of the portal before getting to a version that was deployed.\n\nBefore changing the portal I strongly recommend asking the user who pointed out the issue for a screenshot of how they’ve filled the app out immediately before the error\n\nThe error is almost always (or at least has usually been) something to do with how the user filled out the app or attached their data. If that is the case, you may need only point that out to them (in a polite way) and go about your day\nAlso, the only time the app can break is when they click the “Submit Data” button. Prior to that, the app is not actually trying to do anything, so any app-breaking user error will not be apparent to them until they click that button\nHOWEVER, some users who experience an issue actually create a larger error that will prevent them from uploading their data even after you point the app key issue out to them. To handle such cases, see the next subsection. The importance of this is also noted in part d of the next bullet 3. To change the data portal do the following:\n\n\nFirst, modify the app. R script as desired. Note that every Shiny App consists of three components: (1) the user interface, (2) the server that includes all the internal mechanisms for the portal, and (3) a ShinyApp() call that combines the UI and server.\n\n\nIf the app is not working, it will likely be in the server component\nIf the app doesn’t look right but does function appropriately, modify the UI\nIf the app does not collect some information that it should, you will need to change both the UI and server\nThe ShinyApp call at the end never needs to be modified so don’t worry about that bit\n\n\nSecond, test the app on your computer by running the app\n\n\nIn R Studio, the top right of the R script panel containing a ShinyApp has a “Run App” button to the right of a green ‘play’ button\nPushing this button will create a local version of the portal that functions as the app will but does not deploy to the internet (yet).\nI recommend submitting a test data file (see the folder of the same name for pre-built phase 2 data that you can use) from start to finish to ensure that everything works as desired.\n\n\nThird, once you are satisfied with your changes, you can deploy the app to replace the old publicly-available version on the internet!\n\n\nIn the “deployment-faq. R” script, you will load the “rsconnect” library (line 12) and then use it to redeploy the app (line 18)\nRunning the deployApp function will prompt you in the console to type a “Y” if you’re sure that you want to re-deploy the app\nAfter you type “Y” and hit return in the console, it will build your new portal, terminate the old one, replace the old with the new, and then activate the new one for all users\nYou’ll know this is done when R automatically kicks you to a new tab in your web browser with the new portal open\n\nFourth, and this is crucial, if your changes to the app were because a user was having issues, you need to delete any files they successfully submitted\n\nSee the next sub-section for information on how to do this/why it needs to be done\n\nFinally, notify the user that initially contacted you letting them know that you have resolved the issue on your end, thanking them for bringing it to your attention, and inviting them to reach out again if it still isn’t working for them",

    "section": "25.3 Deleting Old Data",
    "text": "25.3 Deleting Old Data\nThe data portal will fail if it tries to create two files of the same name.\n\nThe amount of information used to create the file name means that it is incredibly unlikely that two different users could accidentally create the same file name\nBUT, as mentioned in the “Updating the Portal” section, it is entirely possible (and has happened previously) for the same user to try to submit data more than once and inadvertently create two files of the same name\n\nThis occurs when the following happens:\nFirst, the user tries to submit data using the portal but something goes wrong so their data aren’t actually submitted (but a blank GoogleSheet of the user-supplied name is created)\n\n\nSecond, the user tries to re-submit data (possibly after you fix the issue in the portal and notify them) but the blank document they unknowingly created earlier now causes a different error (i. e. , that there are now two files of the same name)\nUnfortunately, because Shiny Apps are noninteractive (see the “Service Account FAQ” section) the user will never be provided with an informative error (neither will you) so you’ll need to diagnose this as part of your ‘fixing the app’ process\n\nTo resolve this, I (Nick) have created a second Shiny App that is not deployed\n\nTo be clear, it should never be deployed to prevent its accidental (mis)use by general HerbVar members\n\nJustification and location of the second app\n\nThe second app is in the “Data-Portal-Maintenance” GitHub repository (link)\nThe “Service Account FAQ” section below gives more context but in brief: the ‘app key’ file that the data portal makes users attach is actually activating a sort of Google robot with the authority to create Google Sheets and move them i. This is necessary because an online portal cannot send an authorization request to each user in the way that R/R Studio does when such code is run on a local computer (again, see the “Service Account FAQ” section for more details)\nThis ‘robot’ then is the true owner of all data files submitted through the app\nThe portal cannot submit data to a Shared Drive (due to issues with the R packages that connect R and Google that are outside of our control) so this is an unavoidable state\nSo, if a user accidentally creates a flawed data object of the same name as their real data they will be unable to submit their real data until the flawed one is deleted\nHOWEVER, because the ‘robot’ owns those files, you cannot actually delete any of its files (when you “delete” a file you don’t own you actually just remove yourself as a collaborator with no effect on the original file)\nHere is where we get to the need of a second app\nThe robot’s GoogleDrive cannot be accessed via a Graphical User Interface in the way that you would access any other Google Drive\n\n\nSo, to truly delete these files so a user can re-submit their data successfully, you will need to use this second app\nIf you fail to delete the bad data, the user will never be able to successfully submit data of the same name 1. In theory, you could ask them to re-name their file in some slightly different way (i. e. , by changing their site name), but that would still have this flawed data floating in the ether which is not desirable\n\nTutorial of the second app\n\nTo reiterate, this Shiny app should never be deployed.\nYou will see why, but for the moment, take my word on it that deploying this app has a non-zero potential of permanently deleting data files you actually want\n\n\nBy keeping the script in GitHub and locking view access to only Will & the Data Scientist, we preserve its utility without opening Pandora’s box of deploying it and possibly having an HerbVar member use it improperly\n\n\nThe second app is fully contained in the “check-service-acct-files. R” script (the only script in this project)\nOpen that script and click the “Run App” button in the top right of the R script pane of R Studio\nAs with updating the data submission portal, this will create a new tab in your web browser that contains a fully functional (but not available on the internet) version of the app\nThe app is divided into three columns that you will proceed through from left to right\nFirst, download and attach the key for the service account that owns the files you want to look through (column 1)\nFor now we only have one service account for phase\n\nI recommend creating a new service account for each subsequent phase to evade data storage limits and partition sources of error in a clean, behind-the-scenes sort of way\n\n\nSee below for information on creating Service Accounts\n\n\nSecond, click the “Authorize” button to notify the app that it should attach the app key (column 1)\nThis may take a few seconds but should generate a full list of all files owned by the robot (i. e. , owned by the service account) g. Third, after looking at the list of files, click the “Extract File Names” button (column 2)\nThis just populates the third column so don’t worry about the violence implied by the verb ‘extract’\nFourth, scroll through the drop down list (column 3) and select the file you want to delete (could be a test data file or the product of a specific user’s failed attempt to upload their data)\nFifth, above the dropdown menu, check the “Yes” option beneath “I am ready to delete a file”\nI recommend doing this after selecting a file to further mitigate the risk of deleting the wrong file j. Sixth, click the “Delete Selected File” button i. Because you attached the service account key in column 1, you are viewing and interacting with the robot’s files as the robot (rather than as yourself)\n\n\nThis gives you access to actually delete files rather than just–as mentioned before–removing yourself from seeing the file\n\n\nSeventh, once a dialogue has popped up below the “Delete Selected File” button confirming the file has been deleted, click the “Update List of Drive Contents” button\nThis will update the dropdown menu with the new file list now that the file you marked for deletion has been erased l. Finally, scroll through the dropdown menu (or look at the list of files in column 2) to ensure that all problem files have been deleted 6. After you’ve gone through that process to delete the flawed file, you can notify the user that it is safe for them to resubmit their data\nThis is all likely too much information for the user though so I suggest that you just tell them you have fixed the data portal and leave it at that\n\n\nAlso, I have written the app to work with any service account key that owns Google files so unless the structure of future phases’ data portals changes massively, this app should be sufficient for all issues involving service account-owned files in the future",

So, there is a draft email in the herbvar@gmail account to send when a panel of herbivore experts has been assembled to resolve this uncertainty",
