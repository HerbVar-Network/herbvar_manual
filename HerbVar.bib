	abstract = {Clonal growth of plants is attained by a number of morphologically different organs (e.g. stolons, rhizomes, and roots), which are not functionally equivalent. Consequently, these clonal growth organ (CGO) types can determine functional traits that are associated with clonality, although little is known about their evolutionary flexibility or the constraining role they play on clonal traits. We investigated the rates of evolutionary change by which individual CGOs are acquired and lost using a set of 2652 species of Central European flora. Furthermore, we asked how these individual CGOs constrain functionally relevant clonal traits, such as lateral spread, number of offspring, and persistence of connections. We show that plants can easily switch in evolution among individual types of CGO and between clonal and nonclonal habits. However, not all these transitions are equally probable. Namely, stem-based clonal growth and root-based clonal growth constitute evolutionarily separate forms of clonal growth. Clonal traits are strongly constrained by individual CGO types. Specifically, fast lateral spread is attained by stolons or hypogeogenous rhizomes, and persistent connections are attained by all rhizome types. However, the ease with which clonal organs appear and disappear in evolution implies that plants can overcome these constraints by adjusting their morphologies.},

	abstract = {Several species concepts (SC) have been suggested as ways to view species, most of them based on Mayr's Biological SC. Recent research has raised the debate on the application of the species concepts to Oncocyclus irises. All the Oncocyclus species are able to produce vital progenies when crossed, thus, according to the Biological SC, they are a single biological species. Quantitative morphological characters are continuous among populations and also correlate with environmental conditions, preventing species delimitation according to Phenetic and Ecological SC. Genetic studies revealed high genetic diversity within the populations, thus, obscure delimitation by Phylogenetic SC. Pollination of the Oncocyclus irises is not species-specific, yet no transitional forms exist on the rare occasions of sympatric/parapatric distribution, roughly supporting delimitation according to the Recognition SC. The conclusion is that Oncocyclus populations do not clearly fit into species boundaries according to the relevant species concepts. Oncocyclus irises are distributed along an Ecogeographical Speciation Cline that could lead to one of three patterns of divergence, that is, discrete, ecotonal, or continuous, along the spatial dimension. Nonetheless, the exact variation pattern is not clear because of the patchy distribution. The taxonomic status of the Oncocyclus irises is viewed in light of the evolutionary processes in this highly variable group.},

	abstract = {Many ﬂowering plants exhibit dual reproductive modes, producing both sexual and asexual offspring. The commonest form of asexual reproduction is clonal growth, in which vegetative modules (ramets) are produced by the parental genotype (genet). In plants, sexual and asexual reproduction usually occur simultaneously, and this can lead to allocation trade-offs and antagonism between reproductive modes. Our review considers the ecological and evolutionary consequences of functional interactions between clonal reproduction and pollination and mating. Clonal reproduction is commonly associated with mass ﬂowering, restricted pollen dispersal, and geitonogamous self-pollination, processes that can result in inbreeding depression and pollen discounting. We review evidence for the correlated evolution of clonality and sexual systems, particularly self-incompatibility, and identify several ﬂoral mechanisms that function to reduce mating costs by limiting selﬁng and pollen discounting. We conclude by discussing the loss of sexuality in clonal plants and consider the genetic and environmental basis of sexual dysfunction.},

Species of this section are easily recognized by their inflorescences of a single, large, spherical flower and sepals with a dark signal spot and adjacent beard of multicellular hairs. We present here results of the first phylogenetic study of sect. Oncocyclus based on one low-copy nuclear and six plastid markers from 33 of approximately 42 species and infraspecific taxa. Gene trees are congruent and nuclear markers are more potentially parsimony informative than plastid markers. We identify clades that do not correspond to previously described species groups based on size, color, and shape of perianth parts and show that hypotheses of species monophyly are not supported. In general, diversification is greatest along terminal branches suggesting that species diversified in isolation. The Caucasus is suggested as the ancestral area for sect. Oncocyclus and the eastern Mediterranean as an important area of diversification.},

We developed a workflow for a long-term ecological study that addresses many of the challenges associated with managing this type of data. We do this by leveraging existing tools to 1) perform quality assurance and control; 2) import, restructure, version, and archive data; 3) rapidly publish new data in ways that ensure appropriate credit to all contributors; and 4) automate most steps in the data pipeline to reduce the time and effort required by researchers. The workflow leverages tools from software development, including version control and continuous integration, to create a modern data management system that automates the pipeline.},

	abstract = {Accurate field data are essential to understanding ecological systems and forecasting their responses to global change. Yet, data collection errors are common, and data analysis often lags far enough behind its collection that many errors can no longer be corrected, nor can anomalous observations be revisited. Needed is a system in which data quality assurance and control (QA/QC), along with the production of basic data summaries, can be automated immediately following data collection. Here, we implement and test a system to satisfy these needs. For two annual tree mortality censuses and a dendrometer band survey at two forest research sites, we used GitHub Actions continuous integration (CI) to automate data QA/QC and run routine data wrangling scripts to produce cleaned datasets ready for analysis. This system automation had numerous benefits, including (1) the production of near real-time information on data collection status and errors requiring correction, resulting in final datasets free of detectable errors, (2) an apparent learning effect among field technicians, wherein original error rates in field data collection declined significantly following implementation of the system, and (3) an assurance of computational reproducibility—that is, robustness of the system to changes in code, data and software. By implementing CI, researchers can ensure that datasets are free of any errors for which a test can be coded. The result is dramatically improved data quality, increased skill among field technicians, and reduced need for expert oversight. Furthermore, we view CI implementation as a first step towards a data collection and analysis pipeline that is also more responsive to rapidly changing ecological dynamics, making it better suited to study ecological systems in the current era of rapid environmental change.},

Despite these benefits, the use of GitHub in ecology and evolution is not widespread. To help researchers in ecology and evolution adopt useful features from GitHub to improve their research workflows, we review 12 practical ways to use the platform. We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty, including storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, writing a manuscript, and using automated and continuous integration to streamline analyses. Given that members of a research team may have different technical skills and responsibilities, we describe how the optimal use of GitHub features may vary among members of a research collaboration. As more ecologists and evolutionary biologists establish their workflows using GitHub, the field can continue to push the boundaries of collaborative, transparent, and open research.},

Despite the importance of herbivory, we lack a quantitative comparison of the efficacy of the most commonly used methods used to quantify herbivore damage. 2. We examined the factors that affect the precision and accuracy of visual and digital methods commonly used to quantify damage to leaves. 3. We created 224 digital leaves from four plant species. In a fully factorial design we manipulated leaf morphology and species, the location of damage (marginal or internal), estimation method (exact percentage or 25\% bins), observer experience and expectancy bias (i.e., bias due to an expected result). Using 583 adult observers, we estimated the precision and accuracy of individuals' ability to visually estimate known levels of damage. In a third smaller experiment, we performed similar analyses using a digital scanner. 4. Across the first two experiments, individuals estimated damage with high precision (R2 = 0.75 and 0.80) and accuracy (slopeactual vs estimated = 0.88 and 0.86). However, the precision and accuracy of estimates were influenced by plant species, the location of damage, and estimation method. Inexperienced individuals also overestimated low levels of damage, and this bias decreased with experience. Digital methods were precise (R2 = 0.98) whereas accuracy was statistically indistinguishable from visual methods (slope = 0.91). 5. Visual estimates of damage provide the fastest and most cost-effective method for quantifying herbivory, and our results show they can be precise and accurate. We use our results to provide specific recommendations for future research.},

	abstract = {Plants and herbivores are remarkably variable in space and time, and variability has been considered a defining feature of their interactions. Empirical research, however, has traditionally focused on understanding differences in means and overlooked the theoretically significant ecological and evolutionary roles of variability itself. We review the literature with the goal of showing how variability-explicit research expands our perspective on plant–herbivore ecology and evolution. We first clarify terminology for describing variation and then review patterns, causes, and consequences of variation in herbivory across scales of space, time, and biological organization. We consider how incorporating variability improves existing hypotheses and leads to new ones. We conclude by suggesting future work that reports full distributions, integrates effects of variation across scales, describes nonlinearities, and considers how stochastic and deterministic variation combine to determine herbivory distributions.},

	abstract = {Even though the Goodman–Kruskal gamma (γ) is perhaps the most popular measure of association between two ordinal categorical variables, it does have some well-known limitations. In particular, it is widely recognized that its sample form γ{\textasciicircum} takes on values that may be highly inflated, making it incomparable with other measures such as the frequently used Kendall's tau-b (τ{\textasciicircum}b). Such overstatement of a characteristic, varying in extent, has important implications for the validity and reliability of results and conclusions. By imposing a value–validity condition on association measures, this paper derives an alternative measure γ{\textasciicircum}c as a simple correction of γ{\textasciicircum}. The new measure takes on reasonable values throughout its range from −1 to 1 and is quite comparable with τ{\textasciicircum}b, but has advantages over it. Numerical values of γ{\textasciicircum}c are compared with those of τ{\textasciicircum}b and other measures for various reported datasets, and a statistical inference procedure is discussed.},

	abstract = {Biology has an increasing need to reconsider the tools used to assess the variability of measurements, in addition to their central tendency. More than 100 years after Pearson's publication, most biologists still use the “good old” Pearson's coefficient of variation, PCV, despite its documented flaws such as sensitivity to excess zero values and/or irrelevant low mean values, which may compromise its use in some biological applications. A new statistic was developed in 2017 by Kvålseth, KCV, which is easy to implement. Unlike PCV, KCV is bounded (between 0 and 1), and it can be computed from PCV, ensuring backward compatibility with past studies. In addition to simulated data, we used the recent MASTREE+ database comprising the time series of the fruiting dynamics of perennial plants worldwide to compare the properties of PCV and KCV. Using as a benchmark the loose hump-shaped relationship between the interannual variability of fruiting and latitude, KCV led to significant increase in statistical power as it required almost half as many time series as PCV to detect the relationship. Perhaps most importantly, simulated data showed that KCV allows huge reductions in the length of time series required to estimate the population true variability, saving more than half the duration of long-term monitoring if fruiting fluctuations are very large, which is common in perennial plant species. Compared to the widely used PCV, KCV has great accuracy for estimating and analysing variability in biology, while strongly increasing statistical power. Selecting appropriate tools to assess the variability of measurements is crucial, particularly where the variability is of primary biological interest. Using Kvålseth's KCV is a promising avenue to circumvent the well-known issues of the former Pearson’ PCV, its properties remain to be explored in other fields of biology, for purposes other than purely statistical ones (e.g. estimating heritability or evolvability of traits).},
